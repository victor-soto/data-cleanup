# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore Byebug command history file.
.byebug_history

# Document folders
public/uploads/*
public/uploads/temp/*
public/downloads/*
public/test_files/*
!public/uploads/.keep
!public/uploads/temp/.keep
!public/downloads/.keep
!public/test_files/.keep

# rspec settings
.rspec
